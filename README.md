# Trajectory Comparison: ORB-SLAM3 vs. pySLAM

This repository contains code and data for comparing trajectories generated by two different SLAM systems: ORB-SLAM3 and pySLAM. Specifically, it focuses on computing the Absolute Pose Error (APE) and Relative Pose Error (RPE) of trajectories collected from two environments.

## Files

- **MH01_GT.tum**: EuRoC ground truth trajectory in TUM format.
- **f_ORBSLAM3_EuRoC_TUM_Trajectory.tum**: Trajectory generated by ORB-SLAM3 for the EuRoC dataset.
- **f_pySLAM_EuRoC_TUM_Trajectory.tum**: Trajectory generated by pySLAM for the EuRoC dataset.
- **trajectories_comparison.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing code to plot trajectories with ground truth.

## Trajectory Collection

The pySLAM trajectories were collected using my implementation of trajectory saving, available [here](https://github.com/anathonic/pyslam/tree/trajectory_saving). This implementation supports trajectory saving in three different formats: KITTI, TUM, and EuRoC.

## Dependencies

- **evo**: A Python package for pose evaluation. Install it via pip:

```bash
pip install evo
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anathonic/Trajectory-Comparison-ORB-SLAM3-pySLAM.git
```
